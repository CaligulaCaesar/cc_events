-I need at least two for each ethos. Can include stuff like activate a certain edict, change a certain policy. Failure to comply will make that faction unhappy. This will be player-only

Pacifist:
-End war (if main combatant)
-Do not begin a war (counts as beginning a war if you are the main attacker or in a federation, not the Non-Aligned League though)
-Change policy to no aggressive wars
-Change policy to liberation wars

Militarist:
-Change policy to aggressive wars
-Change policy to liberation wars
-Declare war on rival
-Subjugate x
-Fight the crisis

Xenophile:
-Fight the crisis
-Expand the federation
