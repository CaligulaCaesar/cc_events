dpe_conspiracy.20.desc:0 "Earlier today, [authoritarian.GetTitle] [authoritarian.GetName] held a major speech that was broadcast on all major communication channels. In it, [authoritarian.GetSheHe] came very near to expressing treasonous ideas: [authoritarian.GetSheHeCap] painted a picture of the [root.GetName] beset by challenges whilst the government, feeble and divided, stood by helplessly and did nothing. To solve this state of affairs, [authoritarian.GetSheHe] espoused the need for a new form of government, with a stronger executive - one capable of making the tough decisions required to restore [root.GetAdj] greatness. [authoritarian.GetSheHeCap] hinted that, if the government failed to act, "concerned, patriotic citizens" would have to take matters into their own hands.\n\nSince then, [authoritarian.GetName] has been lying low. [authoritarian.GetHisHerCap] whereabouts are unknown, but [authoritarian.GetSheHe] left a heavily encrypted message apologising for the secrecy, but explaining that [authoritarian.GetSheHe] fear[authoritarian.GetSXX] for [authoritarian.GetHisHer] life in the current political climate. [authoritarian.GetSheHeCap] also left details on how to contact [authoritarian.GetHimHer] if we were to "see reason".\n\nHow should we react?"

However, once we managed to get names from [authoritarian.GetHimHer], it quickly became clear that the majority of the conspirators had taken fright at [authoritarian.GetName]'s arrest and were now in voluntary exile in the [rival.GetName].

dpe_conspiracy.1.desc:0 "To [root.GetRulerTitle] [root.GetRulerName],\n\nNow is perhaps the moment to recognise the vital contribution the fleet plays in ensuring the safety and stability of the [root.GetName], and its standing in galactic politics. We are a powerful force that works tirelessly to counter threats to the state and its citizens. Our highly-trained crews are among the most skilful in the galaxy, and our state of the art warships are second to none.\n\nIt is therefore with deep regret that I view the plight of the navy in internal [root.GetAdj] politics. It is very clear even to our under-officers - let alone our admirals - that the navy is marginalised to the point of being taken for granted. Not only are our marines and officers criminally underpaid, but there is also excessive civilian interference in our activities: Civilian bodies determine our assignments, as well as our recruitment and promotion policies, and can even condemn successful commanders for supposed indiscretions during duty. On matters where the fleet's vital interests are under affected, the fleet simply doesn't have a voice.\n\nThis obstructs the navy from being able to fulfil its proper role in protecting the [root.GetName] from threats. It is not a situation that is in your interests as the [root.GetRulerTitle] to maintain. If there is no change in the state of affairs, we cannot guarantee the survival of the state or your government.\n\nKind Regards,\n[militarist.GetName],\nLeader of the [militarist_faction.GetName] and chosen spokesperson of the [root.GetAdj] Navy"
