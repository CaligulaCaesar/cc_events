This will not count as purging for the purposes of bonuses and penalties, but it will annoy egalitarian empires."

cc_thought_police.2.desc:0 "A battered fleet of small civilian vessels carrying §Y[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! fleeing from the §Y[RefugeeEscapedFrom.GetName]§! have arrived in our space. After we supplied them with food and provided medical attention to their wounded, the refugees were allowed to settle on §H[Root.Planet.GetName]§!.\n\nThese ragged and frightened refugees were political dissidents in the [RefugeeEscapedFrom.GetName], where they were pursued by the [RefugeeEscapedFrom.GetAdj] thought police. They realised that the [RefugeeEscapedFrom.GetAdj] authorities were onto them and that they had to leave immediately, otherwise they would be made to "disappear". They only made it out thanks to the efforts of a hastily organized underground railroad and a few sympathetic merchant skippers."
