############### Caligula's Note to Translators #########################################################
############### This file appears daunting because it has four variations for the regular ##############
############### variants, depending on whether each side has a named leader as a duellist. #############
############### Then there are two for hives and two for machines (also depending on leader ############
############### or not. I couldn't see an easy way to do it simpler. Sorry about that. But #############
############### really, I think the best thing to do is just translate the strings called ##############
############### .no_leader and copy them into root/from/both_leader, and same for ######################
############### .machine/hive.no_leader (or use the $$ function). This will save a lot of ##############
