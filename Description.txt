Stellaris lacks life. There are only fleeting moments when one gets a sense of actually leading a stellar empire with real citizens whose opinions matter. Imagine if we (us Humans) suddenly weren’t the only species on our planet – how we get on with the others would soon be one of [b]the[/b] big topics. Or if machines produced half our output suddenly, one could imagine it might be difficult to adjust. In Stellaris, this is simply expressed by numbers, if at all. And eventually, Stellaris simply becomes an exercise in blobbing, with your populace becoming more or less irrelevant. This mod seeks to change this by adding a large and growing number of event chains that will bring the politics of your empire to life. Some are positive, many are negative (I find Stellaris to be in need of more challenge), others are more ambiguous. They will make you make decisions, not all of which will be obvious. Storylines include:

• Various events to do with integrating alien species, including tensions between species and your attitude towards interspecies marriages.
• Events focusing on pops’ and factions’ specific demands (e.g. emancipation movements).
• Colonisation Stories – your new colonists on a planet might choose their own leader or how they wish to organise themselves.
• Establish a ruler cult to your emperor.
• Factional Revolts (an extensive chain spanning 15 years).
• Various scandals and Conspiracies.
• Events affecting interstate relations. 
• And more (more than 33,000 words of text in total). See the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1227620643/1697168437861698866/]full list of events[/url] (spoilers alert) for details.


An aim of this mod is to make your empire’s ethics more important to the game. So, naturally, some events are more likely to happen if you have a certain ethic (or can only come then). Your choices are also determined by them – for instance, many events have a “Kill. Them. All.” option that is only available to certain empires like fanatic purifiers and fanatic authoritarians. I didn’t want to be too restrictive, though – most of the time, any ethic but egalitarian can choose to oppress pops that protest about stuff.  

As part of the mod, ethic pulls have been rebalanced a bit. The gist is that now if your empire does well, it is better at keeping control of ethics, but if it doesn’t or its pops are displeased, it does worse (more so than in Vanilla). Also, if groups of pops of the same ethic are present on a planet, it will be harder to get rid of them, so opposition will clump – something which is important for factional revolts (and realistic). 

[b]Balance[/b]:
This mod is made to work together with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1112740619]Potent Rebellions 2.0[/url] (same creator :D ). It is highly recommended that you use that mod with this one, as it makes a lot of the events in this mod more likely to come up – and more dangerous (as the name suggests, rebellions are more potent in it!). That said, you can certainly play this mod without it. 

[b]Artwork[/b]:
You will notice some new event pictures and planet modifiers as part of this mod. We could do with a talented artist on our team, though!
 
[b]Bugs[/b]:
Please report anything that seems weird or is a bug.

[b]Compatibility[/b]:
-This mod will not conflict or even overlap with any of the other event mods that I know of, including the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=727000451]More Events Mod[/url]
-I overwrite 00_ethics. The only mod I know that does this is petruxa’s Ethics Rebuild. His will overwrite mine if you play the full Cultural Overhaul, which is fine, because the changes in the file aren’t crucial to my mod and are to his. His will be overwritten if you play any of the sub-versions of it that start with E, though. 
-Many of my events elicit reactions from factions. Obviously, this won’t happen for non-Vanilla factions.
-I have no idea what will happen if you run this with STNH.
-Compatibility with the most popular modded Authorities has been added.
